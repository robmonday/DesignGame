Reflect on Your Design

Document your design decisions by answering the following questions:

    What additional properties did you add to your models and why?
    What were some of the trade-offs or struggles you faced when implementing the new game logic?

These answers should be in a file Design.txt. Your responses can be in paragraph form or bulleted lists. This document should be around 500 words long.
